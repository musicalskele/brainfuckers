# optimized brainfuck interpreter 

this project is a rust implementation of a brainfuck interpreter and optimizer. it reads Brainfuck source code, tokenizes it into opcodes, optimizes these opcodes, parses them into a more manageable format, and finally executes the program. it has no external dependencies other than the standard library.
### usage

```sh
`<program> <file path> [<debug mode>]`

- `<program>`: mame of the executable.
- `<file path>`: path to the Brainfuck source code file.
- `[<debug mode>]`: optional. debug mode, defaults to 0. 
```
